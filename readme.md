# Sports Facility Booking Platform

## Story

Once upon a time in a bustling city, there was Alex, a sports lover with a big dream. He wanted to create a simple way
for people to book sports facilities hassle-free. With his trusty team of developers, they set out to make this dream a
reality.

Using TypeScript, Express.js, and Mongoose, they built the backbone of their platform. They created models for users,
facilities, and bookings, making sure to include all the necessary details. Next came the fun part—designing the API
endpoints. Users could sign up, log in, and book facilities with ease. Admins had extra powers to manage facilities and
view all bookings. But it wasn't all smooth sailing. They encountered challenges along the way, like handling errors and
ensuring security. However, with determination and teamwork, they overcame each obstacle. After months of hard work,
their platform was finally ready. People could now book sports facilities with just a few clicks. Alex and his team
celebrated their success, proud of what they had accomplished together. And so, their simple idea turned into a solution
that made a big difference in the world of sports.

## Project Overview

This project implements the backend API for a sports facility booking platform. It provides functionalities for user
registration, login, facility management, booking creation/cancellation, and retrieval.

## Technology Stack

- Programming Language: TypeScript
- Web Framework: Express.js
- ODM & Validation Library: Mongoose (for MongoDB)

## Installation

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.

## Vercel app

- [live project](https://sports-facility-booking-platform-rho.vercel.app/)

**Steps:**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/hrhabib07/sports-facility-booking-platform/tree/main]
   ```

**2. Install Dependencies:**

- Navigate into the cloned directory:

  ```bash
  cd sports-facility-booking-platform
  ```

- Initialize a new npm project (if not already done):

  ```bash
  npm init -y
  ```

- Install the required dependencies using either npm or Yarn:

  ```bash
  # Using npm
  npm install express mongoose dotenv cors

  # Using Yarn (recommended for better dependency management)
  yarn add express mongoose dotenv cors
  ```

- Install TypeScript and its type definitions for a better development experience:

  ```bash
  # Using npm
  npm install -D typescript @types/express @types/node @types/cors

  # Using Yarn
  yarn add -D typescript @types/express @types/node @types/cors
  ```

**Project Setup (Optional):**

- The provided GitHub repository likely already has a basic project structure. If not, consider creating a standard
  structure for better organization:

  ```
  sports-facility-booking-platform/
      ├── package.json  # Project dependencies and configuration
      ├── src/          # Source code for your application (if using TypeScript)
      │   └── ...        # Your application code goes here
      ├── server.js     # Main server entry point (if using JavaScript)
      ├── ...           # Other project files (e.g., configuration, tests)
  ```

**Running the Application:**

- Refer to the project's specific instructions, typically documented within the codebase or a separate file, for details
  on running the application. This might involve starting a development server using `node server.js` or a similar
  command.

**Live Link (Optional):**

- The provided live link
  ([https://sports-facility-booking-platform-rho.vercel.app/](https://sports-facility-booking-platform-rho.vercel.app/))
  seems to be a deployed version of the project. You can access it in your web browser to see the platform in action.
